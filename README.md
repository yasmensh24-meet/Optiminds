# OPTIMINDS Your First-Aid To Peace 

OptiMinds is a mental health first-aid app designed for teenagers (ages 10-16) in Israel who are struggling with trauma and mental health issues due to recent conflicts. Inspired by Duolingo, OptiMinds provides **interactive, gamified lessons** to help users understand and manage their illness. 

This app **does not replace therapy** but serves as a **first aid tool** for therapists to support their clients.

## Features

- **User Authentication** – Sign up and log in securely.
- **Personalized Symptom Tracking** – Users fill out what are they suffering from to identify their symptom.
- **Customized Learning Paths** – The app recommends units and levels based on the user's symptom.
- **Interactive Lessons** – Each unit contains multiple levels to guide users through mental health education.
- **Progress Tracking** – Users can track their progress and continue from where they left off.
